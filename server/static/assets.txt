Asset Usage

1. Optimize assets before uploading.
2. Place assets in the static/assets directory.
3. Configure Flask to serve static files:
    app = Flask(__name__, static_folder="static")

4. Apply it to a style in your index.css:
    .login-background {
        background-image: url('/static/assets/filename.ext');
        background-size: cover;
        background-position: center;
        height: 100vh; /* Make it full-screen */
    }
    
5. Use the class in a <div>:
    <div className="login-background"></div>
